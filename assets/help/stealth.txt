Stealth


Enemies have a chance to notice you while you are within their stealth range.

When enemies notice you, they go on "alert".

You have one turn to remove yourself from the sight of an enemy before they begin targetting you. Stealth range does not factor in at this point.

Attacking an enemy in melee instantly makes them target you.

Attacking an enemy with a ranged attack puts them on alert.

Cumblobbed enemies stay on alert for 3 turns but are unable to target during those 3 turns.
